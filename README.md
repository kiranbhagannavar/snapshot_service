# snapshot_service
This service helps in creating snapshot at scheduled time of any website.
The best part of this is that you won't have to fill up your inbox or storage space with screenshots, they will automatically store in Wayback machine at http://web.archive.org/.

You will need an stdlib account to build this tool.
